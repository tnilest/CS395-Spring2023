# Cosmic Magnetism
Cosmic Magnetism is a game project I'm working on in Unity Engine. It originally started as a class project, but will be expanded beyond.

The core gameplay mechanic involves pushing and pulling on metal objects to solve puzzles and navigate environments. This is partially inspired by the works of Branden Sanderson, particularly his Mistborn series of books.

the most recent version of the game will soon be availible to test. If you find this and decide you have any feedback for me, I would love to discuss with you. Feel free to message me on GitHub.

Unity Version: 2021.3.16f1

The goal is to develop my skillset by exploring and incorporating the following concepts:
-3D environment. Most of my previous Unity experience has been in 2D, sprite-based games. Here I seek to explore elements of 3D gameplay, including 3D level design, lighting, texture mapping, and animation.
-Physics. Along with the 3D mechanics outlined above, a key component of the gameplay will revolve around physical interactions between the player and the environment. The primary goal being to implement a unique movement system that suppliements conventional movemnent mechanics with "pushing" and "pulling" oneself throughout the environement in a manner that is similar to how magnets might interact.

I do not consider myself an artist, and I plan on pursuing the gameplay mechanics more so than the artistic direction in this project.
