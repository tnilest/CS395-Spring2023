# CS395-Spring2023
A repository to store and track my progress for my Independent Study game development project

Student Name: Travis Nilest
Professor Name: Dr. Ware
Spring 2023
CS395

Unity Version: 2021.3.16f1

The goal is to develop my skillset by exploring and incorporating the following concepts:
-3D environment. Most of my previous Unity experience has been in 2D, sprite-based games. Here I seek to explore elements of 3D gameplay, including 3D level design, lighting, texture mapping, and animation.
-Physics. Along with the 3D mechanics outlined above, a key component of the gameplay will revolve around physical interactions between the player and the envrionment. The primary goal being to implement a unique movement system that suppliements conventional movemnent mechanics with "pushing" and "pulling" oneself throughout the environement in a manner that is similar to how magnets might interact.

I do not consider myself an artist, and I plan on pursuing the gameplay mechanics more so than the artistic direction in this project.

The core "pushing" and "pulling" mechanic is inspired by concepts from Branden Sanderson's Mistborn series of books.
